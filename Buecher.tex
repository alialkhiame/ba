User abilty to use a divice/software is directly related to their ability to unterstand the intended  Funktion


model based desgin ->
design of interavtive applications is still difficult.
Enduser often find interfaces deffecult to understand and use -> reasons-> users find it deffecult to unterstand what 
functions are supported--> how to assosiat logikal action with phisical actions on the interface -> l√∂sung designer had methodes and tools to provide indications about the most effective interaction and presentatuin to suppport possable users

we build models to unterstand Reality and to lead our own way to interact with it

the Goal of an architectural model is a representation wich is useful for the software designers and developers the purpose is sto give an implementation-independent description of the basic components and their possible communication
